Boolean operations can be performed using logic gates; namely OR (+), AND (x), XOR (âŠ•), and their inverse; NOR, NAND, XNOR, and NOT (signal inversion). For more information on Logic Gates, please read the dedicated chapter."

            "text": "Sometimes, a device known as a Clock is used in circuitry. The purpose of a Clock is to output pulses of alternating signals at specified time intervals. In Redstone as well, a redstone clock is used to alternate between ON and OFF for a given number of ticks between every pulse. Note that in Minecraft, 20 ticks equal 1 second in real-time."
